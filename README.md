# hello_world
This is currently my first README file, and while I would love to showcase my work right now, I still have a long way to go to have any semblance of a portfolio. 
If anyone finds this file, just know I am learning JS and working on really some strong foundations in HTML and CSS and I would love to hear any kind of advise. 
I will link my Twitter/X profile for any kind of communication: @IanSamanieg0 
Thanks for reading, and happy coding!


// Dec 7th, 2023 //
I will keep updating this file as I make progress in my studies. For now, I am just leaving my first log here for future me and anyone interested in my journey.
I am currently pursuing to develop my skills and kowledge through the Odin Project with the Foundations and JS courses. At the moment, coding inspires me because it seems to be: 
  a) A way to put my problem solving skills into good use.
  b) A great career path with lesser barriers to entry than other disciplines with heavy implications in math and logical thinking. 
  c) A career with a welcoming environment where I can grow profesionally without strictly requiring a paper to validate my knowledge and capabilities. 
Only time will tell if this is how I continue seeing things in the future, but for now this is  what I want to spend my time learning in hopes of making a better life for myself and enjoying the work I do.
